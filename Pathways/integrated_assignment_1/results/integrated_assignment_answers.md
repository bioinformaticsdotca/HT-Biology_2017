## g:Profiler

**Question**: What is the most significant GO:term? What is the p-value for this GO:term 

**Answer**: extracellular matrix organization: p-value of 1.70e-09 


**Question**: Is this p-value already corrected for multiple testing? What type of correction is used for your current analysis? 

**Answer**: yes, it is already corrected for multiple hypothesis testing. I set the Significance threshold box to  "Benjaminin-Hochberg FDR".

Re-run the analysis with User p-value threshold set to 0.0001. **Question**: What has been changed?
**Answer:** Only the gene-set with pvalue equal or less than 0.0001 are displayed. The list is reduced compared to the results obtained with the default settings. 

Ordered query: **Question**: Do you seen any changes in the output in comparison to the analysis of the unordered gene list (PART 2) **Answer** Although some terms are similar, their pvalues changed as well as the number of term genes used to calculate the pvalue.

**Question** What can you conclude about these networks? **Answer** The pathways are relevant to the biological model under study. The changes are related to the transformation of the epithelial cells into mesenchymal ones.

## DATASET2

## PART1 REACTOME FI

Pathway enrichment on the whole network. 
**Question** What is the pathway with the lowest (best) FDR? 
**Answer** The pathway with the lowest FDR is Endometrial cancer (K) with an FDR equal to 5.78w-16.

Cluster the network and perform pathway enrichment on the network.
**Question** How many clusters did the analysis retrieve?  
**Answer** The analysis retrieved 8 clusters named module 0 to module 7.

**Question** What is the FDR value of the most significant pathway of module 0?
**Answer** Wnt signaling pathway with FDR equal to 4.5e-08

## PART2 GeneMANIA
**Question** What is the number of nodes in the CTNBB1 network. **Answer** There are 22 nodes.

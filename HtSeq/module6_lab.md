# Genome Assembly for short and long reads

by [Jared Simpson](https://simpsonlab.github.io)

## Introduction

In this practical lab we will perform de novo genome assembly for a bacterial genome and a segment of the human genome. We will walk through a genome assembly starting with data quality control, through to building contigs and analysis of the results. At the end of the lab you will know:

1) How to perform basic quality checks on the input data
2) How to run a short read assembler for Illumina data
3) How to run a long read assembler for Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore data
4) How to compare the results of multiple assemblies
